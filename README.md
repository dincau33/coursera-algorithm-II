# Coursera Algorithm II

Coursera Algorithm course provides an introduction to fundamental data types, algorithms, and data structures. Part II focuses on graph and string-processing algorithms.

This repository contains:
* The unit tests I used to validate whether my solution to the course assignments are correct or not. Be mindful it does not cover time and space complexity assessment but only correctness.
* My solution to the course assignments.

# Assignments
* [Week 1 - Wordnet](https://coursera.cs.princeton.edu/algs4/assignments/wordnet/specification.php)

# How to build
`mvn clean test` compile project, run checkstyle, findbugs, PMD, jacoco and execute unit tests.

# Warning
I encourage you to use the unit test defined within this project to test if your solutions is correct or not.
Only look at my solution after trying to solve the assignments by yourselves.
